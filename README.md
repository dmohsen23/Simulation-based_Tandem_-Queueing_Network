This repository provides MATLAB code for solving the Redundancy Allocation Problem (RAP) in tandem queueing networks with reparable subsystems. The goal is to minimize the total queueing and repair costs over time by optimally allocating redundancy and determining repair rates for system subsystems.

Redundancy allocation plays a key role in enhancing system availability and reducing operational costs in service, manufacturing, and communication systems‚Äîmany of which can be modeled as queueing networks. In this study, we specifically address RAP for series-parallel configurations, which are commonly used in industry, and incorporate queueing costs into the optimization framework.
